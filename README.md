# Terraform-EC2-Storage-Automation
In this repository you will find individual modules of EC2, Key-Pair, EBS and Security Group, which are dynamically created.

All these modules are then called in parent (main.tf) files and their values are given there dynamically.

# Note: Be careful about the path of modules while calling them in parent (main.tf) file as per your file structure.
